/*!
 * Create a hash value of a filename consisting of a vector of chars 'A'-'Z'
 *
 * Usually there should not be too many files in one directory. 1) it may – depending
 * on the file system used – degrade performance severely, and 2) it makes operations
 * like rsync, file listings etc. cumbersome if there are thousands of files in
 * one directroy. A common way is to create a tree of subdirectories. In SIPI we use
 * subdirectories named 'A'-'Z' and a configurable number of levels of subdirectories.
 * In order to calculate the path efficiently we use avery prinitive, simple custom
 * hash function whichs "returns" a vector of the characters 'A'-'Z'. We overload
 * the [] operator in order to access the characters.
 *
 * The class may throw a SipiError!
